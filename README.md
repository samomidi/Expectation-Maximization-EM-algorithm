# Expectation-Maximization-EM-algorithm
Given a set of observations of fish lengths spanning three age cohorts, estimate the parameters of the Gaussian (normal) distributions of length-at-age, when the age of each length observation is not known. The probability density function of this mixture distribution is f (x) = λ1φ(x|µ1, σ2) + λ2φ(x|µ2, σ2) + λ3φ(x|µ3, σ2), with λk being the probability of an observation coming from component k and φ is a normal distribution with mean µk and variance σ2. If we knew the component that each observation came from, we would use maximum likelihood to estimate mean  length  µˆk  and  standard  deviation  σˆk  of  each  of  the  k ages.  We  would  also  know  the  proportion  of observations coming from each age cohort λk. However, we do not know which component of the distribution generated each observation (the generation process is “hidden” or “latent”). The key to the estimation problem is therefore to assign labels (ages) to observations by some process, and subsequently perform maximum likelihood estimation of µˆk  and σˆk.  This assignment and estimation is performed repeatedly until the parameter estimates cease changing.
